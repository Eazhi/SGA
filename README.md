# SGA
Sup Grade Analysis

pip dependencies
- matplotlib==3.0.2
- numpy==1.15.4
- pandas==0.23.4
- seaborn==0.9.0
- xlrd==1.2.0

I'll probably do a pipenv later but I'm lazy :shrug:

# How to use
- Download all the grade sheets in .xlsx format in the repo, they are in the gitignore for obvious reasons.
- Execute all the first cells, they are are the ones doing all the data cleaning part.
- Choose the practical you want to see stats on using the slider
- Execute the different data viz cells depending on what you wanna see
