and then
`jupyter notebook`
to launch the notebook.

## How to use
- Download all the grade sheets in .xlsx format in the repo, they are in the gitignore for obvious reasons.
    1. You can either do it by hand or you can click on the 'Download sheets' button.
    2. If you do the latter, you need to get your `client_secrets.json` file before, to do so, visit: https://gsuitedevs.github.io/PyDrive/docs/build/html/quickstart.html#authentication
- Execute all the first cells, they are are the ones doing all the data cleaning part.
